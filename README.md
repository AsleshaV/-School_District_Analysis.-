# -School_District_Analysis.-
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The school board has informed Maria about the CSv file showing the possibility for academic dishonesty. Particularly in the reading and math grades of the 9th graders at Thomas High School. The purpose of this analysis is to perform a new School District Analysis after replacing the reading and math scores for ninth-graders for Thomas High School and write a report how this has impacted the overall analysis.

For this analysis we used the Pandas library in Python. Data from separate CSV files are read into Pandas and merged to create multiple different dataframes and analyzed.


## Results:
